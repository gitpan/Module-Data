NAME
    Module::Data - Introspect context information about modules in @INC

VERSION
    version 0.001

SYNOPSIS
        use Module::Data;

        my $d = Module::Data->new( 'Package::Stash' );

        $d->path; # returns the path to where Package::Stash was found in @INC

        $d->root; # returns the root directory in @INC that 'Package::Stash' was found inside. 

        # Convenient trick to discern if you're in a development environment

        my $d = Module::Data->new( 'Module::Im::Developing' );

        if ( -e $d->root->parent->dir('share') ) {
            # Yep, this dir exists, so we're in a dev context.
            # because we know in the development context all modules are in lib/*/*
            # so if the modules are anywhere else, its not a dev context.
            # see File::ShareDir::ProjectDistDir for more.
        }

            # Helpful sugar. 

            my $v = $d->version;

    Presently all the guts are running of Perl INC{} magic, but work is in
    progress and this is just an early release for some base functionality.

METHODS
  package
    Returns the package the "Module::Data" instance was created for.

            my $package = $md->package

  path
    A Path::Class::File with the absolute path to the found module.

            my $path = $md->path;

  root
    Returns the base directory of the tree the module was found at. (
    Probably from @INC );

            my $root = $md->root

  version
            my $v = $md->version;

            # really just shorthand convenience for $PACKAGE->VERSION 
            # will be possibly extracted out without loading the module first in a future release.
