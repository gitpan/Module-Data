 [Internals]
 - Rework module discovery to be optimistic, check %INC if its there
   already, and if it is, report where it was found, otherwise, ask
   Path::ScanINC to tell us where it is WITHOUT loading it. This will
   hopefully be usefull in many cases allowing us to detect module
   availability without needing the compile/memory overheads of actually
   loading said modules
 - Rework ->version call to be optimistic, ask PACKAGE->VERSION for version
   if the package appears to be loaded, otherwise, fall back on
   Path::ScanINC to find the file, and Module::Metadata to extract the
   version out of it. The hope is that will eliminate the need to load the
   whole module permenantly into memory *just* to discern what version it
   is.
